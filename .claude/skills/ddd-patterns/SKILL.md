# Domain-Driven Design Patterns

## Overview

DDD provides building blocks for modeling complex business domains. The domain
layer is the core — it contains business rules and has no dependencies on
frameworks or infrastructure.

This template provides ready-to-use base classes for every tactical pattern in
`src/shared/domain/`. Subclass them — don't reinvent.

## Tactical Patterns (in this template)

### Identifier (`shared/domain/identifiers/Identifier.ts`)

UUID-based identity. Subclass once per domain id:

```ts
export class UserId extends Identifier {}
```

Equality by string value. Generate fresh ones with `UserId.generate()` (inherited).

### ValueObject<Props> (`shared/domain/valueObjects/ValueObject.ts`)

**Immutable** via `Object.defineProperty`. Defined only by attributes. No identity.

- Props are `protected` — subclasses expose domain-meaningful getters (`get value()`, `get formatted()`)
- Self-validation in the constructor — throw on invariant violation
- Operations return **new instances** (e.g., `Money.add(other)` returns a new `Money`)

### Entity<Id, Props> (`shared/domain/entities/Entity.ts`)

Object with identity that persists over time. Equality by ID. Methods express
business intent (`approve()` not `setStatusApproved()`).

### AggregateRoot<Id, Props> (`shared/domain/aggregates/AggregateRoot.ts`)

Cluster of entities controlled as one transactional unit. External code references
**by ID only**. One transaction = one aggregate root.

- `addDomainEvent(event)` — auto-tracks the aggregate via `setOnTrack()`
- `markForDeletion()` — routes deletion through the persister on commit
- `static reconstitute(...)` — hydration from persistence WITHOUT firing events

### DomainEvent (`shared/domain/events/DomainEvent.ts`)

Something that **happened**. Name in past tense (`UserCreated`, `AddressAdded`).
Required fields: `eventId`, `eventName`, `aggregateId`, `occurredAt`, `causationId`.

Persisted automatically to `system_events` (event store) **in the same transaction**
as aggregate writes. No dual-write.

### Domain Service

Business logic that **doesn't belong** to any specific entity (operations involving
multiple aggregates or complex calculations requiring external data). Place in
`src/modules/<context>/domain/services/`.

### Repository (Port)

Interface for **persistence** defined in `src/modules/<context>/application/ports/secondary/`
(or `domain/ports/`). Implementation in `infrastructure/persistence/`. One per Aggregate Root.
Returns complete aggregates (already reconstituted).

### Factory

Encapsulates complex creation logic. The aggregate's `create()` static method is
typically enough — explicit factory classes are reserved for multi-step assembly.

## Command Factory Pattern (DRY + Hexagonal)

Commands have a **private constructor** + static `of()` factory that receives
primitives and centralizes VO construction.

```ts
export class CreateUserCommand {
  private constructor(
    public readonly userId: UserId,
    public readonly name: UserName,
    public readonly email: Email,
  ) {}

  public static of(name: string, email: string): CreateUserCommand {
    return new CreateUserCommand(
      UserId.generate(),
      new UserName(name),
      new Email(email),
    );
  }
}
```

Adapters (HTTP, GraphQL) call `CreateUserCommand.of(body.name, body.email)` —
they NEVER construct VOs directly. Format validation in the factory; business
validation in the use case.

## Use Cases — Persistence is Automatic

Use cases **never** call `repository.save()`. The aggregate auto-tracks on the
first `addDomainEvent()`, and `MikroOrmUnitOfWork` flushes everything in a
transaction on commit.

```ts
// ❌ Don't
public async execute(cmd: CreateUserCommand): Promise<User> {
  const user = User.create(cmd.userId, cmd.name, cmd.email);
  await this.repository.save(user);
  return user;
}

// ✅ Do
public async execute(cmd: CreateUserCommand): Promise<User> {
  return User.create(cmd.userId, cmd.name, cmd.email);
}
```

## Strategic Patterns

### Bounded Context

Explicit boundary where one model applies. Each context is a vertical slice in
`src/modules/<context>/` with its own `domain`, `application`, `infrastructure`,
`bootstrap`, and `factories` folders.

### Context Mapping

- **Shared Kernel** — `src/shared/` is the kernel; every module depends on it
- **Customer/Supplier** — express via primary/secondary ports in `application/ports/`
- **Anti-Corruption Layer** — translation adapters in `infrastructure/`
- **Published Language** — domain events (event store gives you a published log for free)

### Ubiquitous Language

Code MUST use business language. `CreditProposal` not `CreditRequest`.
`approve()` not `setStatusApproved()`. Names in tests, ADRs, code, and UI must match.

## Behavior Rules

### MUST
- ALWAYS give entities unique identity and behavior
- ALWAYS make value objects immutable (use `Object.defineProperty` via the base class)
- ALWAYS control consistency through aggregate roots
- ALWAYS define repository interfaces in the application/domain layer (the implementation goes in infrastructure)
- ALWAYS create `of()` factory on every Command
- ALWAYS use ubiquitous language in code
- ALWAYS use `reconstitute()` (not `create()`) when hydrating from persistence

### MUST NOT
- NEVER put business rules outside the domain
- NEVER reference aggregates by object across boundaries (use ID)
- NEVER let adapters build VOs directly
- NEVER create anemic aggregates (data without behavior)
- NEVER call `repository.save()` from a use case
- NEVER use ORM annotations/decorators on domain classes (this template uses `EntitySchema`, no decorators on domain)
