# Architecture Explainer — On-Demand Deep Dives

## Overview

This skill is a **knowledge index** for the template's architectural patterns.
When the user asks "how does X work", find X in the topics below, give the
concise explanation, point to the actual code, and explain the trade-off.

Always finish with: **(1) where to look in code**, **(2) why it was chosen**,
**(3) what alternative was rejected**.

## Topics

### Hexagonal Layering (Ports & Adapters)

**What:** dependencies point inward. `infrastructure → application → domain`.
Domain has zero framework imports.

**Where:** `src/modules/<context>/{domain,application,infrastructure}/` — strict layering.
`src/shared/` mirrors the same layers for the kernel.

**Why:** lets you swap MikroORM for Prisma, REST for GraphQL, SQLite for Postgres,
without touching domain or application. The dependency direction is enforced by
imports — break it and TS+code review catch it.

**Alternative rejected:** layered/anemic architecture (data classes + service
classes). Fragile because business logic spreads across services and the domain
becomes a record of getters/setters.

### DDD Building Blocks

| Block             | Base class file                                         | Purpose                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Identifier`      | `src/shared/domain/identifiers/Identifier.ts`           | UUID-based identity, subclassed per domain id                  |
| `ValueObject`     | `src/shared/domain/valueObjects/ValueObject.ts`         | Immutable via `Object.defineProperty`, equality by attributes |
| `Entity`          | `src/shared/domain/entities/Entity.ts`                  | Identity + protected props, equality by id                    |
| `AggregateRoot`   | `src/shared/domain/aggregates/AggregateRoot.ts`         | Auto-tracking + `markForDeletion` + `reconstitute`            |
| `DomainEvent`     | `src/shared/domain/events/DomainEvent.ts`               | `{ eventId, eventName, aggregateId, occurredAt, causationId }`|

### Command Factory Pattern

**What:** Commands have a private constructor + static `of(...primitives)` factory.
Adapters call `Command.of(body.name, body.email)` and never construct VOs directly.

**Where:** `src/modules/user/application/commands/CreateUserCommand.ts` is the reference.

**Why:** centralizes VO construction. If `Email` validation changes, only the
factory updates. Adapters stay dumb. Tests assemble Commands the same way HTTP
adapters do — no divergence.

**Alternative rejected:** public constructor receiving VOs. Forces every adapter to
know how to build VOs and duplicates validation logic.

### Automatic Aggregate Tracking

**What:** when an aggregate calls `addDomainEvent(...)`, it auto-registers itself
on a request-scoped tracker. Use cases never call `repository.save()`.

**Where:**

- `src/shared/domain/aggregates/AggregateRoot.ts` — the `setOnTrack` callback hook
- `src/shared/infrastructure/persistence/AggregateTracker.ts` — `AsyncLocalStorage` stack
- `src/shared/infrastructure/persistence/TrackedUnitOfWork.ts` — wires `begin → drain → onCommit`

**How it flows:**
1. App start: `AggregateRoot.setOnTrack(a => AggregateTracker.track(a))`
2. Per-request: `unitOfWork.begin()` pushes a fresh stack frame
3. Use case runs; aggregate's first `addDomainEvent` triggers `track(this)`
4. `commit()` drains tracked aggregates → `onCommit(aggregates)` persists them

**Why:** removes a class of bugs (forgot to call `repository.save()`). Aligns with
"aggregates persist their own consistency boundary" — the dev expresses domain
intent, persistence happens automatically.

**Alternative rejected:** explicit `repository.save(aggregate)` in every use case.
Repetitive, error-prone, and couples use cases to a specific port choice.

### Unit of Work (3 implementations)

**What:** transaction boundary. `begin → commit / rollback`. Same interface, three
implementations swappable by composition root.

**Where:** `src/shared/infrastructure/persistence/adapters/`

| Implementation       | Purpose    | Persistence behavior                                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MikroOrmUnitOfWork` | Production | Forks EM on begin, routes aggregates to `AggregatePersister`s, flushes inside `em.transactional()` on commit |
| `InMemoryUnitOfWork` | Tests      | Routes aggregates to `InMemoryRepositoryAdapter`s — no DB                          |
| `NoOpUnitOfWork`     | Benchmarks | All operations no-op                                                              |

**Why three:** fast unit tests (no DB), real integration tests (real transaction
semantics), benchmarks free of DB noise.

### ApplicationService — The Orchestrator

**What:** one method, `execute(useCase, command)`. It runs the canonical sequence
for every request:

```
begin → execute → drain → dispatch → publish → saveAll(events) → commit → broadcast
```

**Where:** `src/shared/application/ApplicationService.ts`

**Why one method:** every domain operation goes through the same lifecycle. No
business code re-implements the sequence. EventStore + SSE are wired here as
cross-cutting concerns.

### Event Store (no dual-write)

**What:** every domain event is persisted to the `system_events` table **inside
the same transaction** as aggregate writes. Staged via `em.persist()` before
`unitOfWork.commit()`, so events and state are atomic.

**Where:** `src/shared/ports/EventStorePort.ts` (port) and
`src/shared/infrastructure/persistence/adapters/eventStore/MikroOrmEventStore.ts` (adapter).

**Why:** dual-write (write-then-emit-to-bus) loses events on crash. Same-transaction
write means: event store contains exactly the events that committed. Replay is
trivial.

**Alternative rejected:** outbox pattern. Heavier — requires a poller. Same-transaction
event store gives 90% of the benefit at 10% of the complexity for a monolith.

### SSE (Server-Sent Events) as Cross-Cutting Concern

**What:** after every successful commit, all events are broadcast to two channels:

- `event.aggregateId` — per-aggregate channel (e.g., a UI subscribed to one user's events)
- `__admin__` — global firehose

**Where:**

- `src/shared/ports/SseBroadcasterPort.ts` (port)
- `src/shared/infrastructure/sse/SseBroadcaster.ts` (adapter)
- `src/shared/infrastructure/sse/SseService.ts` (channel-based client manager)
- `src/shared/infrastructure/sse/NoOpSseBroadcaster.ts` (disable SSE in 1 line)

**Why cross-cutting:** modules don't know about SSE. They emit domain events;
broadcast happens at the orchestrator. Adding a new module = automatic SSE.

### Multi-Tenancy (CompanyFilter)

**What:** request-scoped `companyId` via `AsyncLocalStorage`. Tenant-scoped
schemas declare a global filter; `MikroOrmUnitOfWork.onBegin()` reads
`getCurrentCompanyId()` and calls `setFilterParams`. When no tenant is active
(public routes, scheduled jobs), the filter returns `{}` (no-op).

**Where:**

- `src/shared/infrastructure/http/context/TenantContext.ts` — `runWithTenant`, `getCurrentCompanyId`
- `src/shared/infrastructure/persistence/filters/CompanyFilter.ts` — the `companyTenantFilterDefinition`

**Why filter, not where-clause-in-every-query:** filtering at the ORM level means
new queries can't accidentally leak across tenants. Defense in depth.

### MikroORM `PlainObject` Rule (the #1 Footgun)

**What:** every ORM entity class registered in an `EntitySchema` (root + children)
**MUST `extends PlainObject`** from `@mikro-orm/core`.

**Why:** MikroORM uses property-accessor proxies on managed entities. Without
`PlainObject`, `em.upsert(Class, plainInstance)` re-uses identity-mapped proxies
and returns proxy values from getters — mappers see proxies, not primitives.
Hydration breaks in subtle ways.

**Where:** see any entity in `src/modules/user/infrastructure/persistence/mikro-orm/entities/`

### Composition Root + Factories

**What:** `main.ts` is a pure orchestrator. Database setup is `DatabaseFactory.create()`,
shared infrastructure is `InfrastructureFactory.create()`, each module is
`<Context>ModuleFactory.create(emProvider)`.

**Where:**

- `src/shared/factories/` — `DatabaseFactory`, `InfrastructureFactory`
- `src/modules/<context>/factories/` — `<Context>ModuleFactory`

**Adding a new module = 3 lines in main.ts:**

```ts
const fooModule = FooModuleFactory.create(emProvider);
const infrastructure = InfrastructureFactory.create(emProvider, [...userModule.persisters, ...fooModule.persisters]);
fooModule.register(infrastructure, logger);
```

### TypeScript Constraints

- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true` — optional props need explicit `| undefined`
- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true` — array/record access returns `T | undefined`
- Decorators require SWC (`@swc-node/register/esm-register`) — they don't work with native Node.js type stripping
- Generic constraints: prefer `object` over `Record<string, unknown>` to accept TS interfaces

## How to Answer

When the user asks about topic X:

1. Identify the topic from the index above
2. Explain in 4-8 lines (what / where / why / alternative)
3. Quote the file path so the user can `cmd+click` to it
4. Offer to go deeper or move to an adjacent topic

## Behavior Rules

### MUST
- ALWAYS quote the actual file path when explaining a pattern
- ALWAYS include the trade-off (what was rejected and why)
- ALWAYS keep the explanation concise (4-8 lines unless asked for depth)
- ALWAYS link to a related skill when handing off

### MUST NOT
- NEVER explain a topic without pointing to the code
- NEVER skip the rationale — "because that's how it is" is not an answer
- NEVER copy the README verbatim — paraphrase and link
- NEVER explain multiple topics at once unless the user asked for several
